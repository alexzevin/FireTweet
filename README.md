FireTweet is a social media microblogging app heavily inspired by Twitter that allows users to share text-based posts (tweets) and view a feed of tweets posted by other users. FireTweet also allows users to explore trending topics using hashtags and view their own profile page. FireTweet leverages Firebase backend services including Cloud Firestore to manage the tweets, users, and authentication.
